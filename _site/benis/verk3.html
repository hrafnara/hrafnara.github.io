             We're no strangers to love
             You know the rules and so do I
             A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
             You wouldn't get this from any other guy
             
             I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
             Gotta make you understand
             
             Never gonna give you up
             Never gonna let you down
             Never gonna run around and desert you
             Never gonna make you cry
             Never gonna say goodbye
             Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
             
             We've known each other for so long
             Your heart's been aching, but
             You're too shy to say it
             Inside, we both know what's been going on
             We know the game and we're gonna play it
             
             And if you ask me how I'm feeling
             Don't tell me you're too blind to see
             
             Never gonna give you up
             Never gonna let you down
             Never gonna run around and desert you
             Never gonna make you cry
             Never gonna say goodbye
             Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
